# AOZ-SOC-and-OffSec

A repository showcasing my skills and experience in Security Operations (SOC) and Offensive Security. Focused on real-time log analysis, SIEM management, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment.

# 👨‍💻 Ahmet Oz - SOC Analyst & Offensive Security Professional

Hi, I'm Ahmet, a passionate and versatile cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in both Security Operations (SOC) and Offensive Security domains. My mission is to identify threats before they become breaches and understand the attacker's mindset to defend more effectively.

## 🛡️ SOC Analyst Expertise

With strong practical experience in real-time log analysis, SIEM management, and endpoint detection, I actively work with:

- **🔍 IBM QRadar** – Creating & tuning correlation rules, offense investigation
- **📊 Splunk** – Real-time dashboarding, threat detection via queries (SPL)
- **🛡️ CrowdStrike & SentinelOne** – Endpoint detection, triage, and incident handling
- **🔥 Firewall Log Analysis** – Reviewing logs to detect suspicious activity
- **📌 Jira** – Managing incidents and cases within security response processes


## 💣 Offensive Security Skills

In offensive security, I focus on penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and exploit analysis, using a wide range of tools and techniques, such as:

- **🐉 Kali Linux** – The go-to OS for any pentester
- **💥 Metasploit, Venom** – For exploitation and payload generation
- **🕵️‍♂️ Nmap, Acunetix, Nessus** – Scanning and vulnerability assessment
- **🧪 Burp Suite** – Web application testing, intercepting traffic and manipulating requests
- **💻 John the Ripper, Hydra** – Cracking credentials and brute-force attacks
- **🧩 MariaDB, Pentest Monkey** – Data exfiltration and SQL injection testing


## 🔁 Real-Time Log Analysis & Alert Management

Whether defending or attacking, everything starts with logs. I specialize in analyzing logs to detect anomalies, correlate events, and trace attacks step-by-step. Alert fatigue is real — so I build smart, actionable alerts that matter.


## 👥 Team Collaboration

I’ve worked freelance on various collaborative security projects — participating in both Red Team and Blue Team efforts, where communication, timing, and precision were crucial. I’m a strong believer in learning-by-doing and hands-on problem-solving.



## 🔐 Platforms & Labs

- **🎯 TryHackMe** – Regular CTFs and hands-on labs
- **🧠 Cisco Networking Academy** – Security training & simulations
- **🔍 Always exploring new platforms, bugs, and tools to stay up to date
